# Overview

This is a remix of [DIY Machine's 3D printable BB8 robot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2749613/files).

It replaces the stock Arduino Uno with an ESP32 DevKit and includes a reed switch to turn the robot on/off. In addition, a generic L298N motor controller board replaces the original motor shield
